# Why and how do you collect my data?

Positive Peter mainly provides an automated application for chat and social platforms, (the "Service") and is operated by [Polar](https://polar.blue/) (the "Developer", "we", "us") for users of the Service (“you”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from users of the Service. Under applicable law, the Developer is the "data controller" of personal data collected throughout your usage of the Service.

# What information do you collect?

We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when configuring settings within the Service, or interacting with the Service.
Specifically, we store:
- your unique user identifier (hashed), when you trigger a response or edit a setting within the Service
- your unique community identifier (hashed), when you change a community-wide setting within the Service

Apart from this, we do not store any data.

# Where is my data processed?

The Devloper is based in the United States. No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to the United States and other countries. The laws of the United States and other countries governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.

# What do you do with my data?

We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.

We use your data to:
- persist settings for your user account
- persist settings for your community

# Do you sell my data?

We do not sell your data. We do not share your data. We use your data only as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

# How do I contact you?

If you want to get access to the exact data we store, please contact us via email at contact@polar.blue with any means of identifying which data belongs to you, e.g. for data related to Discord, this would be a user ID. We will then start the process and provide you with a collection of all personal data we collected about you within 30 days, given the identification you provided was sufficient.

You have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal data in certain circumstances - for example, if we have no lawful basis to keep using your data, or if you think your personal data is inaccurate. In this case, please contact us via email with any means of identifying which data belongs to you. We will then start the process and remove or modify all required personal data we collected about you within 30 days.
